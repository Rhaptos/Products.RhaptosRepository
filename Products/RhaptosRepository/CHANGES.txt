      was hardcoded. getDefaultLicense.py is still not in a license tool like it should be, but 
      it's moved from RMS to RhaptosContent, and there's now a getLicenseData method both on 
      content and on the ModuleDBTool that pulls license data from the postgres database.

    - add new metadata field for 'roles'

RhaptosRepository-0.65
  - upgrade to Plone 2.5

RhaptosRepository-0.64.5
  - fix #4012: Refactor session-based recent searches to use cookies instead.
    Existing search history generated many conflict errors in TemporaryStorage,
    and using cookies doesn't cause any storage activity. Replaces and behaves
    exactly like the original, and may even be a little faster, since this one
    calculates 'format_search_string' on set instead of display.

RhaptosRepository-0.64.4
  - fix #4008: recent searches portlet was using non-virtual server path 
    information to build the URL. Apply same fix as 0.64.1

RhaptosRepository-0.64.3
  - fix #4005: The workgroup-Top/Bottom-through-method-call was lost during
    form refactoring of advancedsearch, apparently. We used to push the form to
    different URLs starting with Top/ or Bottom/ depending on the button, using
    the :method technique. The FormControllerization of the form dropped that, but
    left the location on the field name, breaking both top and bottom submit. Now,
    it a better way, using the 'button' element to allow having variable values for
    the submit element without having different button labels.

  displaying them correctly in the author/maintainer fields

RisaRepository-0.27
  - Fixed the broken advanced search "links"
    (s/advanced.html/advanced_search/g), then commented out all the
